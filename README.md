# Commerce

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for Project 2 (Commerce) from CS50W. Commerce is a web application developed with Django, geared towards simplifying online auctions. Its functionalities enable users to generate listings for items they wish to sell, bid on available listings, engage in discussions via comments, and oversee a watchlist of items they're keen on.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:

- **URL Configuration (`urls.py`):** Defines the URL patterns for different views in the application.
- **Views (`views.py`):** Contains the logic for handling HTTP requests and rendering HTML templates.
- **Models (`models.py`):** Defines the database schema using Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- **Templates:**
  - **Layout Template (`layout.html`):** Provides a common layout structure for other templates.
  - **Individual HTML Templates:** Separate templates for different views like index, listing, category, etc.
- **Static Files:**
  - **CSS (`styles.css`):** Contains custom styles for the application.
